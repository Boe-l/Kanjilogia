### Features

- **Language Indicator:** The app displays a prefix icon in the text box to indicate the language of each word, with a flag icon. This is especially useful when multiple languages are selected to prevent confusion between similar words.
- **Font Adjustment:** Users can adjust the font size of the words using the mouse wheel or pinch gestures on mobile, providing an accessible and customizable experience.
- **File Import:** The app supports importing and loading JSON data files, which are stored in an Indexed DB for web users or an Isar DB for mobile and Windows platforms.
- **File Download:** Users can download files directly from GitHub via the settings tab or import local files.
- **User Preferences:** User preferences, such as maximum response time and font settings, are saved using Shared Preferences, ensuring that the app remembers the customized settings between sessions.
